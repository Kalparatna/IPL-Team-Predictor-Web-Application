Certainly! To include a link to your project output result video "Result.mp4" in the README.md file, you can add a section like this:

```markdown
## Project Output Result Video
Check out the project output result in this video: [Result.mp4](link_to_your_video)

```

Make sure to replace `link_to_your_video` with the actual link or path to your "Result.mp4" video. If the video is hosted on a platform like YouTube or Vimeo, you can provide the direct link to the video.

If the video is within the project directory, you can provide a relative path like `static/videos/Result.mp4` assuming you have a `videos` directory within the `static` folder.

Here's an example with a relative path:

```markdown
## Project Output Result Video
Check out the project output result in this video: [Result.mp4](static/videos/Result.mp4)
```

Remember to ensure that the video file is accessible and that users can view it without any issues.
